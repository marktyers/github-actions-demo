A shell script is just a text file containing a sequence of commands, just like a regular program written in a language such as JavaScript.

The big difference is that the commands are those we already use in the bash shell! This makes it ideal for automating processes.

Shell scripts are ideal for:

1. Processing batch jobs. These can be triggered by system events such as git commands or cron tasks.
2. Writing programs that contain similar functionality to those written in other languages such as Python.
3. Creating shortcuts to make your life easier when administering servers.

In this section of the lab you will learn the basics of writing shell scripts. Once you have mastered this you will learn how to write special scripts called **Git Hooks**.
