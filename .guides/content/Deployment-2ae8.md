One of the key capabilities of any DevOps process is to be able to automatically deploy working software to a live server.

Rather than manually setting up a web server modern software engineers take advantage of online hosting solutions that can provide pre-configured virtual servers and a suite of tools to manage the deployment process. These services also provide a number of plug-ins to provide services such as databases and email handlers.

One of the most popular hosting platforms is [Heroku](https://heroku.com) and this is the platform you are going to learn about in this lab.

Heroku allows engineers to build and deploy live services using CLI tools that can be run from the terminal.

There is a free-tier offering that allows you to deploy a number of low-powered servers for no charge.
