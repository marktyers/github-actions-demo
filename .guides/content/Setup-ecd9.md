Before starting this lab you will need to perform some simple setup tasks. These have been provided as a shell script `setup.sh` so all you will need to do is make the script executable and then run it:

```shell
$ ./setup.sh
```
This performs the following four steps:

1. Updates the currently installed software and installs some useful extras.
3. Installs the latest version of Node at the system level using [NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md).
4. Installs the NodeJS packages used in the exercises.

If you are curious you can see the individual steps by examining the `setup.sh` file.
